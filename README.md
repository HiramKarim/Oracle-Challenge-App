# Oracle-Challenge-App
This repository represents the oracle challenge app to develop.

This application is build using clean architecture methodology. For a better performance the storyboard is removed.

- MVVM-C pattern is implemented.
- The Coordinator pattern is implemented to handle navigation.
- The network layer is created using conbine to handle network call efficiently. Also, we use generics for this approach.
- Module-type is implemented for list-detail application
- A Constants class was created to keep mainURL and api url's
- A Extentions class was created to handle control creation and type-functions for controls and variable types.
